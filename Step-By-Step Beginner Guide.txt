STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
==================

This is a step-by-step guide for first-time users of the MA Labs Serial Port
Reader program. For more detailed information on the program, see the
"README.md" file.

This program requires the Java SE Runtime Environment 8.

The Java SE Runtime Environment 8 downloads are available here:

    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

If you do not already have a Java SE Runtime Environment that is up-to-date,
select the download specific to your operating system in the format you prefer
and install the software before continuing with this guide.

This program also requires the RXTX library, which can be downloaded here:

    http://rxtx.qbang.org/pub/rxtx/rxtx-2.1-7-bins-r2.zip

Follow the instructions included in the zip package. The steps taken are
specific to which operating system your computer uses.

If you have any issues, see the troubleshooting section in the "README.md" file.
The "README.md" can be viewed with a web browser or text editor, but is meant to
be viewed from GitHub at:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Get your API Access keys - there are 3 of them: Application Key, Access
        Key, API Secret Key.

    For details on how to get your API keys, go to:

        http://www.maintenanceassistant.com/api/docs/guide.html#api_keys
    
    IMPORTANT: Write the keys down, they'll be needed whenever you begin the
               program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Connect a device that sends data to a serial port to your computer.

    An Arduino Uno outputs to the serial port, and can be used with this
    program. For information on the Arduino, go to the page:

        http://www.arduino.cc/

    Example Arduino code using a potentiometer has been included in the
    "examples" folder.

    IMPORTANT: Make sure the device is on, and is sending data to the serial
               port before moving on to the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Start the Serial Port Reader program.

    To run the Serial Port Reader program, double click on the file named:

        "MALabsSerialPortReader.jar"

    The program will begin running.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5:	Input your credentials from step 1, and then click "Set Credentials".

    The program requires your CMMS API URL, which is your CMMS URL with "/api/"
    added to the end. For example:

        https://youraccount.macmmms.com/api/

    For sandbox accounts, the example is:

        https://youraccount.masandbox.com/api/

   IMPORTANT: Make sure to include the "https://" in the URL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: Input the asset ID that your serial port device is linked to and the
        unit ID of the meter reading.

    The program needs very specific values to run. It is meant for a single
    asset, and only one type of meter reading.

    To find the ID of an asset, take the following steps from a desktop:

        1. Log into the CMMS (if not already logged in).
        2. Select "Assets" from the menu on the left.
        3. Click on the "Set Visible Columns" button.
            -The button is a small image of a list made of squares and
             rectangles, located to the far right of the page, above the list
             of assets.
        4. Check the box labelled "id".
        5. Click the "OK" button.
        6. The ID value of the assets should appear as a new column in the list.

    To find the ID of a meter reading unit, take the following steps:

        1. Log into the CMMS (if not already logged in).
        2. Select "Assets" from the menu on the left.
        3. Click on any asset.
        4. Click on the "Metering/Events" tab.
        5. Click on the new meter reading image.
            -It is a little page with the top left corner folded and a plus sign
             over it, located in the bottom left corner of the chart of "Most
             Recent Meter Readings".
        6. Click on the downward pointing arrow beside the box for meter reading
           units.
        7. Click on the "Set Visible Columns" button.
            -The button is a small image of a list made of squares and
             rectangles, located to the upper-right corner of the pop-up, above
             the list of units.
        8. Check the box labelled "id".
        9. Click the "OK" button.
        10. The ID value of the units should appear as a new column in the list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 7: Enter the serial port that the device is plugged into, then click "Begin
        Program".

    If you are using an Arduino, you can take the following steps to
    find the port your Arduino is using:

        1. Open the Arduino program for writing sketches.
        2. Click on the "Tools" menu.
        3. Hover over the "Port" option.
        4. The list of all plugged in Arduino boards will appear with which
           ports they are connected to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 8: Make sure the program is running properly.

    The program should be nothing but a window and some text saying "Running",
    followed by the last meter reading value taken from the device outputting
    to the serial port.

    To close the program, just click on the "x" in the top right corner of the
    window, then click "Yes" on the pop-up. This will safely close the program.
    Closing the program other ways can lead to complications with the serial
    port.

    If any issues occur, see the troubleshooting section in the"README.md" file.
